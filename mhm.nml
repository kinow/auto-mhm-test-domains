!>            This flag is unique and valid for all domains.
!>            Depending on the choice of this flag you need to process your soil database differently.
!
!> iFlag_soilDB = 0:
!>            Read and process the soil database in a classical mHM format which requires:
!>               i) a single gridded ASCII file of soil-id (soil_class.asc - hard coded file name)
!>              ii) a single soil look-up-table file (soil_classdefinition.txt) with information of
!>                  soil textural properties for every horizon.
!
!>            Here mHM is quite flexible to handle multiple soil layers as specified in "nSoilHorizons_mHM"
!>            and depths provided in "soil_Depth(:)".
!
!>            The tillage depth is flexible in this case.
!
!>            The depth of last mHM modeling layer is determined according the information given in the
!>            input soil database, which could vary spatially depending on the soil type. Therefore the
!>            user should not provide the depth of the last modeling layer. For example if you choose
!>            nSoilHorizons_mHM = 3, then soil_Depth should be given for only soil_Depth(1) and soil_Depth(2).
!>            Any additional depth related information would be discarded

nSoilHorizons_mHM = 2
!> Provide below the soil_Depth() for 1,2,..,*n-1* soil horizons. Depth of the last layer(n) is taken from the soil LUT
