!> \details This file contains the namelist for mRM outputs.
!! 1. First give the timestep for writing gridded model outputs
!!    It should be integer and has to be perfectly divisible
!!    by the number of total modeling time steps
!! 2. Define main outputs of the model as namelist
!!    the particular output flag is specified as .TRUE. / .FALSE
!!    for writing /not writing the output to a file
!!
!! SYNTAX = ".TRUE." or ".FALSE."
