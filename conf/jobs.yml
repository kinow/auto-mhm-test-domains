  PREPARE_TEST_DATA:
    FILE: templates/prepare_test_data.sh
    PLATFORM: local
    RUNNING: once
    TITLE: 'Fetch mHM test domain data, prepare containers for the run'
    DOC: |
      This task will fetch the test domain data
      for mHM from their Git tag. Then it will prepare
      the Singularity containers to run.
  SYNC:
    FILE: templates/sync.sh
    PLATFORM: local
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: PREPARE_TEST_DATA
    TITLE: 'Synchronize the test data with the run platform'
    DOC: |
      This task synchronizes the local files with
      the remote platform. More specifically, it
      will `scp` the singularity image.
  SIM:
    FILE: templates/sim.sh
    RUNNING: date
    DEPENDENCIES: SYNC
    TITLE: 'Run simulation on the target platform'
    DOC: |
      This is the main task of the workflow. It
      will replace the period dates in the test
      mhm.nml creating a new file to be used in
      the simulation with mHM (--nml).
  GRAPH:
    FILE: templates/graph.sh
    RUNNING: date
    DEPENDENCIES: SIM SIM-1
    TITLE: 'Plot graph on the target platform'
    DOC: |
      This is the step in the simulation, where
      we plot the graphs for mHM.
  COPY_GRAPH:
    FILE: templates/copy_graph.sh
    PLATFORM: local
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: GRAPH
    TITLE: 'Copy the graph created by the run'
    DOC: |
      This task copies data produced by mHM
      to the local platform.
  CLEAN:
    FILE: templates/clean.sh
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: COPY_GRAPH
    TITLE: 'Clean files'
    DOC: |
      The very final step. It will stop and clean
      the containers used for this simulation. It
      will also delete the output files of mHM.
