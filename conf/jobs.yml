  SYNC_TO_REMOTE:
    FILE: templates/sync_to_remote.sh
    PLATFORM: local
    RUNNING: once
    TITLE: 'Synchronize local data to remote platform'
    DOC: |
      This task sychronizes the local files with
      the remote platform. More specifically, it
      will `scp` the singularity image.
  REMOTE_SETUP:
    FILE: templates/remote_setup.sh
    PLATFORM: remote
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: SYNC_TO_REMOTE
    TITLE: 'Remote setup'
    DOC: |
      This task will fetch the test domain data
      for mHM from their Git tag.
  SIM:
    FILE: templates/sim.sh
    PLATFORM: remote
    RUNNING: date
    # TODO: SIM has a dependency on SIM-1 to control
    #       the number of SIM jobs running in parallel.
    #       But this would not be necessary if mHM
    #       had an option to choose the output folder.
    DEPENDENCIES: REMOTE_SETUP SIM-1
    TITLE: 'Simulation'
    DOC: |
      This is the main task of the workflow. It
      will replace the period dates in the test
      mhm.nml creating a new file to be used in
      the simulation with mHM (--nml).
  GRAPH:
    FILE: templates/graph.sh
    PLATFORM: remote
    RUNNING: date
    DEPENDENCIES: SIM SIM-1
    TITLE: 'Plot graph'
    DOC: |
      This is the step in the simulation, where
      we plot the graphs for mHM.
  SYNC_FROM_REMOTE:
    FILE: templates/sync_from_remote.sh
    PLATFORM: local
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: GRAPH
    TITLE: 'Synchronize remote data to local platform'
    DOC: |
      This task copies remote data produced by mHM
      to the local platform.
  CLEAN:
    FILE: templates/clean.sh
    PLATFORM: remote
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: SYNC_FROM_REMOTE
    TITLE: 'Clean remote files'
    DOC: |
      The very final step. It will stop and clean
      the containers used for this simulation. It
      will also delete the output files of mHM.
