JOBS:
  LOCAL_SETUP:
    FILE: templates/local_setup.sh
    PLATFORM: local
    RUNNING: once
    TITLE: 'Fetch mHM test domain data, prepare containers for the run.'
    DOC: |
      This task will test test the Singularity container, prepare
      the local run directories, and download the mHM test data.
  REMOTE_SETUP:
    FILE: templates/remote_setup.sh
    PLATFORM: remote
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: LOCAL_SETUP
    TITLE: 'Create remote directory.'
    DOC: |
      This task simply creates the remote workflow run directory.
  SYNC:
    FILE: templates/sync.sh
    PLATFORM: remote
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: REMOTE_SETUP
    TITLE: 'Synchronize the test data with the remote platform'
    DOC: |
      This task synchronizes the local files with
      the remote platform. More specifically, it
      will `scp` the singularity image.
  SIM:
    FILE: templates/sim.sh
    PLATFORM: remote
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: SYNC
    TITLE: 'Run simulation on the target platform'
    DOC: |
      This is the main task of the workflow. It
      will replace the period dates in the test
      mhm.nml creating a new file to be used in
      the simulation with mHM (--nml).
  GRAPH:
    FILE: templates/graph.sh
    PLATFORM: remote
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: SIM SIM-1
    TITLE: 'Plot graph on the target platform'
    DOC: |
      This is the step in the simulation, where
      we plot the graphs for mHM.
  COPY_GRAPH:
    FILE: templates/copy_graph.sh
    PLATFORM: local
    RUNNING: once
    DEPENDENCIES: GRAPH
    TITLE: 'Copy the graph created by the run'
    DOC: |
      This task copies data produced by mHM
      to the local platform.
