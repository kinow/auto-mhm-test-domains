PLATFORMS:
  REMOTE:
    TYPE: ps
    # See bootstrap/include.yml, as that file loads another
    # file with platform settings that can override these.
    HOST: <REMOTE_HOST>
    USER: <USER>
    ADD_PROJECT_TO_HOST: false
    # A directory used to write data during the run.
    SCRATCH_DIR: <REMOTE_SCRATCH_DIR>
    # In HPC this is normally a string like proj_1234, and
    # is also a directory name, shared by a list of users
    # members of the unix group with the same name proj_1234.
    # In our case, this string will be combined with the
    # SCRATCH_DIR to define the workflow run directory in
    # the platform (local, or remote).
