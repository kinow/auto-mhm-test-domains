This repository contains the configuration for an Autosubmit
workflow that runs mHM with its test domain data. A Docker
container is used to run mHM.

An Autosubmit workflow created with
`autosubmit expid -H local -d "mHM" -min -git https://github.com/kinow/auto-mhm-test-domains.git` when triggered will clone this repository,
and prepare the Docker & Singularity containers, transfer over
to the remote platform (can be `localhost` for testing) and
execute the mHM model for each start date (as the mHM simulation
period date). Finally, the workflow plots the data before cleaning
the simulation logs and files.

The plots are copied back to the local workflow folder, and
everything can be used to package an RO-Crate.

TODO: document the `rocrate.json` used to help populating the
`ro-crate-metadata.json` (partials, with license, author, inputs,
and outputs)â€¦
