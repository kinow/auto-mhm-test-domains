This repository contains a Dockerfile to create a container
for running mHM version 5.12.0. It also includes the default
namelists for that version.

This repository will be cloned by Autosubmit to run a simple
workflow with mHM, containers, and with the default test
data for 5.12.0 (we pretend this data exists somewhere
like a shared file-system, as that is how it would be
commonly set up).
